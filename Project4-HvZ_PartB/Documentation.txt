Project 4 Humans vs Zombies

Description:
My project is an example of autonoums agents using 3d modeled knights and skeletions. Both try to avoid the towers. Knights evade skeletons and skeletons pursue knights. 
GameObjects of the same type seperate from each other.

Functionality
C: Switch Camera view

Above and Beyond:
Added ablity to switch between multiple camera views by pressing C. 2 of the camera views are views from the perspective of skeletons. These camera views are smoothed out using
the provided script. Also added terrain around the orginal platform.
